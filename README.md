# TGSemu
Emulator for the TGS, darkscience's dcc, written in C.
The challenge itself is located [over here](https://github.com/darkscience/dcc).
Just run make in project root. Start the emulator with `./bin/tgs <demo file here>`, e.g. `./bin/tgs demo2.bin`.

Tested in a VTE terminal, but it should work fine with any...
